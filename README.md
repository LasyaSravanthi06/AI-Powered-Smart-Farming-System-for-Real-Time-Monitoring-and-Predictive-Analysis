# AI-Powered-Smart-Farming-System-for-Real-Time-Monitoring-and-Predictive-Analysis
The AI-Powered Smart Farming System is a comprehensive solution aimed at transforming conventional agricultural practices through the integration of artificial intelligence and geospatial technologies. This project focuses on predicting crop health, water usage, and pesticide usage by utilizing satellite imagery, weather data, and soil information. Unlike traditional farming methods that rely on manual monitoring and guesswork, this system delivers real-time, data-driven insights to farmers, enabling them to make timely and efficient decisions.

The core architecture includes a machine learning model trained to analyze vegetation indices like NDVI, climate data from weather APIs, and soil profiles to assess crop conditions. Based on this analysis, the system generates predictions and actionable recommendations, such as the optimal amount of irrigation required or targeted pesticide application levels. This leads to reduced wastage of water and chemicals, ultimately lowering operational costs and environmental impact.

The frontend of the application is built using React, providing a responsive user interface for farmers to interact with real-time predictions and geospatial maps. The Flask-based backend handles API requests, data processing, and integration with external sources such as satellite and weather services. The system does not depend on physical sensors, making it cost-effective and scalable, especially for small and medium-sized farms.

Moreover, the system includes location-based services to personalize recommendations based on regional climate conditions and soil types. By automating data acquisition and decision support, the smart farming system enhances productivity, supports sustainable agriculture, and helps mitigate risks related to climate change and pest outbreak
